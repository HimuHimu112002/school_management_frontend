        An e-school, or electronic school, is an online learning platform that
        allows students to access education and resources via the internet
        rather than attending a traditional, physical school. E-schools can
        range from primary and secondary education levels to college courses and
        professional development programs. With the advancement of digital
        technology, e-schools have become increasingly popular, offering an
        alternative or supplementary option for learning.
